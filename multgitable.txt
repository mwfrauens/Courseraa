Employeetable  AND Jobstable appear to be loaded right.

HOWEVER THEY DON'T ALWAYS HAVE COLUMN HEADERS.  wHY?  AND I hAVE NOT SEEN HEADERS FORMATED AS IN THE ANSWERS PROVIDED.

There is the first query using both tables.

There is also the associated failer of the first query.

When should the table be kn CAPS?  It is never capped in the class instruction.
